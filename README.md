# KTH Calibration of the Hull-White Model
This project was completed as part of the SF2975 Financial Derivatives course during my semester exchange at KTH Royal Institute of Technology, Sweden.

The objective is to calibrate a one-factor Hull-White model to market data; the <b>actual submission is not included in this repository</b>, only the Jupyter Notebook.
